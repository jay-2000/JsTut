- Breaking the loop

Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.

But we can force the exit at any time using the special break directive.

For example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no number is entered:

```
let sum = 0;

while (true) {

  let value = +prompt("Enter a number", '');

  if (!value) break; // (*)

  sum += value;

}
alert( 'Sum: ' + sum );
```

The break directive is activated at the line (*) if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, alert.

The combination “infinite loop + break as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.
